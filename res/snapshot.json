I also added some randomness.\n\nYou can  also challenge another player for a PvP match. If both you and the challenged player have an I-AM-HUMAN SBT, then you will also receive an ELO rating, which updates respectively once a game is finished.\n\n#### How will money matches work?\n\nYou will be able to challenge another wallet for a game and attach any arbitrary amount of NEAR.\nThe attached NEAR will be the price pool for that game and if the challenged wallet accepts, it also needs to attach the same amount of NEAR adding it as well to the price pool.\n\nIf the challenger decides to cancel the game creation after sending funds he can do so as long as the challenged wallet hasn't accepted and he will receive a full refund.\n\nThe price pool will be automatically distributed to the winner's wallet, but there is a 5% fee that will be moved to the smart contract's treasury.\n\n#### How does the treasury accrue value?\n\nThe treasury will receive 5% of price pools from PvP money matches.\n\nIt will also receive 50% of the burnt gas on every AI game transaction.\nOn Near every transaction only burns 70% of the gas that it should have burnt.\n30% will instead go to the executed smart contract's wallet as a developer incentive.\nChess On Chain will share 50% of this gas incentive (resulting in 15% of total burnt gas) and move it to the treasury.\n\n#### How does the P2E token work?\n\nAfter winning a PvP or AI match some amount of fungible token (FT) will be minted and moved to the winner's wallet.\nThe amount of minted FT still needs to be decided.\n\nThe FT will be fully backed by the treasury.\nThere will be a burning mechanism similar to Skyward Finance token where you can receive a share of the treasury for burning FT.\nThis mechanism effectively gives the FT a lower bound for its value.\nThe lower bound changes depending on token inflation/burn and treasury size.\n\nThe received share of the treasury is based on the ratio of burnt tokens compared to circulating supply.\n\n_Example:_\n\n- Circulating supply: 1k FT\n- burnt supply by user: 10 FT\n- burnt / circ = 1% => user receives 1% of NEAR in treasury\n\nThere are also plans to introduce protocol owned liquidity.\n\nAdditional utility for the FT yet needs to be decided. Possible solutions:\n\n- OG NFT mint with unlimited cap, but every mint increases future mint prices. Minting burns FT.\n- establishing partnerships with other NFT projects, where said NFT gives you an advantage.\n\n#### When?\n\n_Soon_.\n\n-----\n\n_developed by [Mario](https://marior.near.social)_\n","linktree":{"github":"Protocol-Pawns","website":"near.org/chess-game.near/widget/ChessGameLobby","twitter":"ProtocolPawns"},"image":{"ipfs_cid":"bafkreic45bf5wdsnxcgnfemd5dthzcyetuxctvri7diyoi7shr66lx4vb4"},"tags":{"game":"","dapp":""},"horizon_tnc":"true","category":"open-source","dev":"mainnet","distribution":"open-source","stage":"pre-seed","fundraising":"no"}}},{"index":92,"accountId":"motus_dao.near","data":{"profile":{"horizon_tnc":"true","name":"MotusDAO","verticals":{"desci":"","social-impact":"","education":"","infrastructure":"","creative":"","defi":"","metaverse":""},"product_type":{"dao":"","ai":"","tooling":"","nft":""},"dev":"idea","team":{"":"8"},"tagline":"Universal Healthcare System","description":"We aim to decentralize and democratize high quality healthcare, starting with mental health.
